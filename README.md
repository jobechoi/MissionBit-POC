### What we will build in the next 10 minutes
---
Using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), we will write a small program that can take a multiple-choice exam, given to us as a [text file](../master/mce.txt), and make a micro game that works on a mobile phone for people taking the California Real Estate Sales License examination.

### Start with your team
---
After a general big group chat, we'll break into 5-person teams. 
Each team will need to seat the following roles:
* Lead developer
* Developer - intergration
* Developer - enablement

### Your tools
---
Whatever's clever for now. We'll get better, more full-featured tools to speed development in the next sprint. But for now, let's keep it stul.
