### What we will build in the next 10 minutes
---
Using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), we will write a small program that can take a multiple-choice exam, given to us as a [text file](../master/mce.txt), and make a micro game that works on a mobile phone for people taking the California Real Estate Sales License examination, and encapsulates it into a single page app (aka SPA).

Here's a similar game that's already been built: https://agilesimulation.herokuapp.com/

**_TFY: You can use Twee2 to decompile Twee2-games into the original .tw2 file_**

Here's how to set up the [demo](../master/demo.md)

### Start with your team
---
We'll break into 5-person teams. 
Each team will need to seat the following roles:
* Lead developer
* Developer, specializing in CI/CD/CL
* Developer, specializing in enablement & onboarding
* Developer, specializing in launch & "gsd"

### Your tools
---
Whatever's clever for now. We'll introduce you to better, more feature-rich tools to speed development in the next sprint. While the final decision on what tools to use are always yours, for now, let's stay STUETL.
