### What we will build in the next 10 minutes
---
Using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), we will write a small program that can take a multiple-choice exam, given to us as a [text file](../master/mce.txt), and make a micro game that works on a mobile phone for people taking the California Real Estate Sales License examination.

Here's a similar game that's already been built: https://agilesimulation.herokuapp.com/

**_TFY: You can use Twee2 to decompile Twee2-games into ther base .tw2 file_**

Here's how to set up the [demo](../master/demo.md)

### Start with your team
---
We'll break into 5-person teams. 
Each team will need to seat the following roles:
* Lead developer
* Developer - intergration
* Developer - enablement
* Developer - CI/CD/CL
### Your tools
---
Whatever's clever for now. We'll get better, more full-featured tools to speed development in the next sprint. But for now, let's keep it stul.
